    <h1>Celeste's Amazing Adventures</h1>
    <h2>Traveling in Sweden</h2>
    <p div class="body"> I did not do a done a lot of research, and simply did not know what to expect.
        But from the moment I stepped out in the cool Sodermalm district and 
        saw the city for the first time, I knew Stockholm was not like other 
        cities; its character wasnâ€™t made homogenous by skyscrapers that made 
        the sky seem small, rush-hour traffic, and the cacophony of too many 
        people or too many cars.</p>

    <p div class="body"> As I walked under beautiful blue summer skies by colorful toy-box like 
        buildings (some from the 1850s), vintage stores with window displays 
        that can only be described as adorable, and leafy, shaded parks, I knew 
        that I had found the perfect city to base myself to slow down and work.
        Over the next month, I spent my days wandering around the citys many neighborhoods,
        visiting museums, enjoying summer like the locals in the parks, writing by waterfronts,
        hopping on ferries to explore the islands in the Stockholm Archipelago, and eating at 
        market halls, all to realize that while there was plenty to do and see in Stockholm, 
        life in the city never felt rushed like it can in other cities.</p>
